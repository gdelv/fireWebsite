## Description
- Global warming is the long-term rise in the average temperature of the Earth's climate system. It is a major aspect of current climate change, and has been demonstrated by direct temperature measurements and by measurements of various effects of the warming.
- We can only combat it by raising more awareness and by making old habits into more sustainable ones.
- My friend currently works for an energy consulting firm. He told me how much he hated his "2001-looking" website -https://www.ptrenergy.com/, and how he would like to have incorporate a team page as well to showcase their team.
- Once I took a look at it I saw that there was too much content and did not know what to look for, for my website I wanted to have only the most important content.
- I wanted to have a live video of a solar and wind energy working in real time to show the user the real power and feel of sustainable living.

## Inspiration

- [www.mint.com](https://www.mint.com)  
    The main color pallet and layout was gotten from this website. At first I started with a green background, once I saw this shade of white and use of shadows I had a better idea on how to incorporate it into my project.

- [https://solarify.in/](https://solarify.in/)  
    Solarify is a website I stumbled upon on my research. The way they incorporated a **calculator** on the side which calculates the users savings, sort of how Geico would to display a customers quote instantly; makes the user's decision to switch companies a lot easier and less searching for other companies. Prompting a **contact form** after completing the calculator could be a possible feature. Also near the bottom where they display **past jobs as a carousel** and show the job information I found to be a key feature I could also incorporate. At first once I opened the page for the first time I liked the way the they added the **CSS animation** for the clouds and once I scrolled to the bottom I knew it wouldn't be fair if I didn't add the rotating globe to my design as well as a **CSS animation.**

- [Renewable Energy Template](http://www.templatemonsterpreview.com/fr/demo/73652.html?aff=webcatalog)
    This is a template found online that deals with renewable energy and I liked the responsiveness for the mobile and tablet such as the black header with work hours, address and phone number making it easier for the user to see in a small screen.


# Ideas

- Since hover does not work with video as we want to we will add animation to transform anchor links to 1.2x their size.

- CSS animation to add a bird flying across the page on load and repeat every 15 seconds.

- CSS animation to make navigation bar spread out when page loads.

- Add globe at team page for the visual link to home page.

- Add team picture as a link to team page.

- Add JS functionality to team page picture's. Make each picture show the overlay of the position of the corresponding picture.

- Add JS functionality to pause video if user would like to.


# Technology Used

- HTML -> Used to structured content of the website

    - With the use of HTML I was able to layout all of my content in the order I wanted it.
    - Added name specific classes and ID's to make it easier to style on CSS.
    - Created container to be able to use flexbox inside of in CSS

- CSS -> Used to display a page's appearance 
    - With the use of CSS I was able to position every block and inline element where I wanted them to be.
    - Created margins for all blocks as well as padding for the text boxes to display a better look for the user.
    - Added animations for the bird flying across the screen and for navigation bar to spread out on load.
    - Created the responsiveness so user is able to see the website through any type of device no matter their screen width.
- JavaScript -> Used to create a page's functionality
    - With the use of JS I was able to create the brain of the website and do specific things when a user clicks in certain places of the website.
    - Added functionality to team page by making the overlay text appear when the user clicks on a picture, and dissappear when he double clicks the overlay.
    - Added a way to pause the video at anytime the user would like to.
